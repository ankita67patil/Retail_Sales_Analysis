# Retail_Sales_Analysis

This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover insights about sales, profit, discounts, and customer segments. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we process and visualize the data. An Excel/PDF dashboard is also created to highlight key metrics like total sales, profit margin, top categories, best regions, and city-wise performance. The analysis helps in understanding business trends and can assist retail managers and analysts in decision-making.
